# Connect-3

This is my AI elective's 3<sup>rd</sup> assignment. We had to make an optimal AI opponent using mini-max with α-β pruning. Refer [Instructions.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnEnigmaticBug/Connect-3/master/Instructions.pdf) to know the specifics of the assignment.

To run the code, simply `cd` into the directory and do `python3 main.py`.

Like Connect-4, the first player can always force a win by playing optimally. So, don't waste time trying to win or force a draw. Its not going to happen.

PS: The GUI code is really shit. GUI is ugly. Due to the submission deadline and a quiz just the day after, I cobbled together TKinter code from a couple of stackoverflow posts. But hey, it somehow works. Maybe I'll fix it. Maybe not.
